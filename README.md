# reminder -API version
ACIT 2520 Final Project
Ability to modify and delete reminders
The following has been made :
Start up the reminderlist application starter reminder list and walked throught the steps that has been provided in the class.
- Added the modify reminder function code which I believe it worked.
- Added the delete reminder function code which I believed it worked.
- In this folder's there is two file one to do list application with ejs file and that contains the reminder list application and along with the api working concept.
- In the same folder I have included a (html with javascript file) that the complete to do list which you can easily add,update, and delete a note from it.
- I have also included the images from the unsplash API format and put the images in the todo html file. I had trouble with the a bit ejs file however I am going to improve over the summer redo the assignment for my own to practise to get the sense how you complete the same format with the ejs file version.
- Thank you, and have a good day.
